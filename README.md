# Portfolio Project

In this portfolio project, I used a variety of technologies to create a dynamic and engaging website. The website was built using **Next.js**, which is a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering and other performance optimizations. Additionally, I used **Formik** and **Yup** to handle form validation and submission, respectively.

For styling, I used **Tailwind CSS**, which is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs. I also utilized **Three.js**, a powerful library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.

To ensure a high level of interactivity and user engagement, I incorporated several other libraries into the project, including:

- **TypeScript** for improved type checking and a more robust development experience.
- **Math.js** for advanced mathematical computations and visualizations.
- **Email.js** for seamless email integration and contact form submission.
- **Framer Motion** for smooth and fluid animations.
- **React Vertical Timeline Component** for creating a visually appealing timeline of my work experience and education.
- **React Toastify** for displaying alerts and notifications to the user.
- **React Parallax Tilt** for adding depth and dimensionality to various elements on the page.

Together, these technologies helped me create a polished and professional portfolio website that showcases my skills and experience as a developer.
